Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained
by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.
You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

Example

For n = 2, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 13.

n2  1 + 4 = 5
n3  5 + 8 = 13
n4  13 + 12 = 25
n5  25 + 16 = 41
n6  41 + 20 = 61
n7  61 + 24 = 85
